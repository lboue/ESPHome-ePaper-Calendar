## Overview
This README provides instructions for printing and assembling a 3D printable case for the ESPHome ePaper Calendar. The case design includes two versions to accommodate different viewing angle preferences.

## Printing Instructions

The 3D model files for this project are available on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/806222-epaper-calendar). There are two versions of the case, which differ in the tilt angle of the screen—25° and 20°. Choose the angle that best suits your viewing preference. I personally prefer the 25° version.

## Assembly Instructions

### Preparing the Battery:
1. Apply electrical tape to the bottom of the battery.
2. Slide the battery into the compartment and secure it to the case by folding the tape over the battery onto the case.
3. Route the battery cable through the designated channel. The positioning does not need to be exact, but ensure that the cable is roughly fixed in place.

### Inserting Threaded Inserts:
1. Use a soldering iron to install two [M2.5 threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/M2-M2-5-M3-M4-M5/dp/B0C2HGNYLX) into the holes at the bottom of the front panel.
2. Insert the power and wake-up buttons into the front casing.

</p>

### Assembling the Case:
1. Place the ePaper board into the front case and lay it flat.
2. Carefully slide the back panel into the front panel, ensuring the cable stays in its channel and does not get damaged.

3. Before the case is fully closed, connect the battery connector to the Inkplate 6.
4. Once the case is fully assembled, secure it with two M2.5 screws to complete the assembly.
