## Printing

The 3D files for this project can be found on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/806222-epaper-calendar).  

There are two versions, differing only in the angle at which the screen is tilted back. I personally prefer the 25° version, but a 20° version is also available.


## Assembly

Apply electrical or other tape to the bottom of the battery, insert the battery into the compartment and tape it to the case as shown. Secure the battery cable in the cable channel, it does not need to be perfect. You could also skip this and just hold the cable in place.

You will need to use a soldering iron to insert two [M2.5 threaded inserts](https://www.amazon.com/M2-M2-5-M3-M4-M5/dp/B0C2HGNYLX) into the holes at the bottom of the front panel. Insert the power and wake up buttons into the front casing.

Insert the epaper board into the case and lay it flat on a table.  
Slide the back panel into the front panel, making sure the cable is in its channel and that it is not scratched too much.

After sliding the case halfway in, connect the battery connector before closing the case completely.

Once closed, you can screw in two M2.5 screws and you are done.
